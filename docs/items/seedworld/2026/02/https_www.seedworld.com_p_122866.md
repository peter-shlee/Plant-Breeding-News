# Transgenic Corn and Soy Drive Cuba’s Push to Boost Grain Production

Cuba remains heavily dependent on imported corn and soy, limiting feed production and agricultural output.

Researchers and producers agree these crops are key to reducing imports, strengthening food sovereignty, and improving animal feed supply and farm profitability.
