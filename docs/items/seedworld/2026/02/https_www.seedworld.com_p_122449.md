# Powdery Mildew Outsmarts Wheat by Masking Key Effector Signal

University of Zurich scientists uncovered how wheat powdery mildew can bypass genetic resistance without losing its key effector AvrPm4. The fungus deploys a second effector that masks AvrPm4 from the Pm4 resistance protein, yet this suppressor is itself detectable by another wheat resistance gene. Stacking both genes could trap the pathogen and improve durable, low-fungicide wheat protection. The post Powdery Mildew Outsmarts Wheat by Masking Key Effector Signal appeared first on Seed World .
