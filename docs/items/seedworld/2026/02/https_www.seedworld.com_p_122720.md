# Gene Discovery Could Unlock New Era of Barley Breeding

Scientists at The James Hutton Institute have identified HvST1, a “Sticky Telomeres 1” gene that boosts genetic recombination in barley. Mutations reduced chromosome ‘stickiness’ during meiosis, unlocking genome regions and giving breeders more flexibility to combine traits like drought and disease resistance. The discovery, linked to the International Barley Hub, could speed barley development and inform strategies in other crops.
