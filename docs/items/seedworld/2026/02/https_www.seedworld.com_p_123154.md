# Boosting Soil Carbon Through Smarter Miscanthus Selection

Aberystwyth University researchers report new Miscanthus traits that could boost soil carbon storage, helping climate change mitigation. Published in Frontiers in Plant Science, the study analysed leaves, roots, and rhizomes from 11 varieties. Results suggest woody rhizomes can push carbon deeper into stable soil layers, while lower-lignin roots support carbon near the surface. The findings guide breeding of high-yield Miscanthus with stronger climate benefits. The post Boosting Soil Carbon Through Smarter Miscanthus Selection appeared first on Seed World .
