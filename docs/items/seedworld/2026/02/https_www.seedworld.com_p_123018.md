# Brazil at the Forefront of AI-Driven Soybean Yield Prediction

Brazil leads AI-driven soybean yield prediction by applying transfer learning. Researchers adapted a U.S.-trained model to Brazilian conditions using limited state or municipal data, improving cross-scale prediction from 50% to 78% of the theoretical best. The approach addresses data scarcity, supports market forecasting, sustainability analysis, and risk assessment, and offers a scalable pathway for global food security and climate-resilient agriculture.
