# Combating Seed Piracy to Protect Mexico’s Agricultural Productivity

AMSAC has launched its “No Harvest Surprises” campaign to combat seed piracy, a growing threat to Mexico’s agricultural productivity. Pirated seed sold via unauthorized vendors often fails genetic and phytosanitary standards, increasing risks of poor germination, pests, and crop losses. Certified seed supports reliable yields, climate resilience, farmer income, and long-term agricultural innovation.
