# $2M Grant Backs AI Initiative to Protect Crops from Disease

The Sainsbury Laboratory has secured $2 million from Google.org’s $20 million AI for Science Fund to launch Bifrost, led by Professor Sophien Kamoun. Using DeepMind’s AlphaFold3, Bifrost will predict plant immune receptor–pathogen interactions from genome sequences to speed breeding of disease-resistant crops. Open-source tools and datasets will support global collaboration and reduce reliance on chemical pesticides in climate-stressed farming systems.
