# Embrapa identifies wild arachis gene that primes defense in cultivated crops

Research by Embrapa shows genes from wild peanut relatives can boost resistance in cultivated peanuts to drought, nematodes, and fungal diseases. The AdEXLB8 gene activates defense priming, preparing plants to respond faster to stress without reducing yield. This biodiversity-based biotechnology strengthens sustainable breeding and reduces reliance on chemical controls.
