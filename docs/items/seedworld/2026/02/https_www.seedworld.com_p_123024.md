# Chilean Research Identifies Molecular “Switch” Behind Plant Drought Resilience

Chilean researchers report a molecular “switch” that helps plants balance growth and drought survival. Published in PNAS, the study identifies the protein NLP7 as a key regulator: it activates growth genes when nitrogen is available but should be restrained under water stress. Disabling NLP7 led to earlier stomata closure, less water loss, and improved drought tolerance—guiding future resilient crop strategies.
