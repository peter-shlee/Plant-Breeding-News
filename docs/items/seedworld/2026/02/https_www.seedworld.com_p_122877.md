# Advancing Gene-Edited Potatoes to Cut Post-Harvest Losses

Gene-edited potatoes developed by Chile’s INIA show significantly reduced post-harvest browning, helping cut food losses across processing, storage, retail, and households. Using CRISPR to edit the PPO2 gene without introducing foreign DNA, researchers achieved non-transgenic lines that retain quality and shelf life. The innovation supports sustainability, efficiency, and Chile’s regulatory pathway for gene-edited crops.
