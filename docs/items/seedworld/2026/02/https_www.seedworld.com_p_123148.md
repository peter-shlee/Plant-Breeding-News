# Study Warns of Rising Heat Risks for Global Wheat Yields

New research from Rothamsted Research suggests heatwaves during wheat flowering may soon pose a bigger threat to yields than drought. Using climate projections and the Sirius wheat model, researchers found drought impacts at flowering may ease slightly, while heat stress damage rises sharply. By 2050, global yield losses linked to extreme heat at flowering could increase by about one-third, and by 2090 by over three-quarters—highlighting the need for heat-tolerant varieties.
