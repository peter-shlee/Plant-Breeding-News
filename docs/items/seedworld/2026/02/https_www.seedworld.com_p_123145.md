# Large-Scale DNA Variants Drive Cucumber History, Study Finds

A new Nature Genetics study led by Boyce Thompson Institute’s Zhangjun Fei reveals that large DNA “structural variants” play a major role in cucumber evolution and breeding. Using a graph-based pangenome built from 39 high-quality genomes, researchers identified nearly 172,000 variants affecting traits like fruit shape and hollowness. The resource helps breeders predict performance, reduce harmful genetic baggage, and accelerate development of resilient, high-quality cucumber varieties.
