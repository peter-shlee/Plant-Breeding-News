# Half the water, competitive yields: INTA advances quinoa irrigation research

INTA San Juan research shows quinoa can thrive in Argentina’s Cuyo region using just half the irrigation water cited in international benchmarks. With 260–290 mm per cycle, the Morrillos INTA variety achieved about 1.7 t/ha, with only 10–20% yield reduction and good grain quality. Drip irrigation enables precise control, boosting water savings and production predictability.
