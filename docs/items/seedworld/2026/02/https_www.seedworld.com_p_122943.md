# Euroseeds Publishes Updated Position on Research

Euroseeds’ updated position paper calls on the EU to secure dedicated plant breeding research funding under FP10 and the European Competitiveness Fund to strengthen sustainable agriculture, the bioeconomy and EU competitiveness. The seed sector reinvests up to 20% of turnover in R&D, yet public support is declining via FP, ERC and MSCA. Euroseeds urges robust budgets and partnerships to deliver climate-resilient yields, food security and strategic sovereignty.
