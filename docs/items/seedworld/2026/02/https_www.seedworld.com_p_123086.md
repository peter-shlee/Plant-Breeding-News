# New Research Reveals Camelina’s Climate Adaptation Potential

EU-funded UNTWIST research shows camelina (Camelina sativa) could help climate-proof agriculture as heatwaves and droughts intensify. Scientists tested 54 camelina lines across controlled environments and European field trials, finding wide variation in stress responses despite limited genetic diversity. Some lines used metabolic shifts, others physical traits, revealing high plasticity. Identified metabolites and fatty acids may guide breeding, while the UNTWIST Plant Adaptation Hub shares open datasets and tools.
