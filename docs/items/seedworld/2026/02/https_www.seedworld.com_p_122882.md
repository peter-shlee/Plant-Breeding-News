# Discovery May Help Barley Growers Better Manage Seed Dormancy

University of Adelaide researchers, partnering with Carlsberg Research Laboratory, mapped a key barley MAPK enzyme–substrate complex that regulates seed dormancy. Published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, the work clarifies how MKK3 activates downstream MAPK signaling and helps explain dormancy-to-germination control. The discovery could support precision breeding to optimize dormancy, reduce pre-harvest sprouting, and improve crop management efficiency in barley and other grains.
