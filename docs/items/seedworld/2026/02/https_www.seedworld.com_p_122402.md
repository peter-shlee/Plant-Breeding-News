# Low-Cost NIR tech speeds coffee authentication and traceability

Research by Embrapa Rondônia shows near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) can rapidly and cheaply identify coffee origin and detect adulteration. The non-destructive method creates chemical “fingerprints” to verify terroir, reinforce geographical indications, and combat fraud. Validated for Brazilian coffee, NIR supports quality certification, traceability, and access to specialty markets.
