# Chile Advances Regulatory Clarity for New Plant Breeding Technologies in Agriculture

Chile’s Ministry of Agriculture, through SAG, proposed a resolution to formalize the technical procedure used to evaluate plant materials developed with New Breeding Techniques (NBT). The framework increases legal certainty, transparency, and oversight, distinguishing NBT products from regulated transgenic GMOs. Mandatory pre-field, case-by-case reviews support health and environmental protection, strengthen public confidence, and encourage innovation for climate-resilient, sustainable food production.
