# Ahead of Leaders’ Retreat, Agri-Food Chain Calls for Stronger EU Support

Ahead of the EU Leaders’ Retreat on 12 February, 40 agri-food organisations urge EU institutions to put agriculture and food at the heart of Europe’s competitiveness strategy. The €1 trillion EU agri-food value chain underpins food security, resilience and jobs, but faces rising regulatory complexity, administrative burdens and global uncertainty. Signatories call for simplification, investment and innovation to boost productivity, circularity and strategic independence. They back Commission efforts, urging further legislative modernisation.
