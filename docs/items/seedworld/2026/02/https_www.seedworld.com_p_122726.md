# Closing the Nutrient Loop: How Wastewater Could Power Future Farming

Researchers at Wageningen University & Research are testing circular fertilizers made from wastewater, including treated human urine, as low-emission alternatives to inorganic fertilizer. Early trials show urine nitrogen can be up to 25% more efficiently absorbed by crops. The research aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce reliance on fossil-based fertilizers, and support sustainable, circular farming systems, pending regulatory changes and public acceptance.
